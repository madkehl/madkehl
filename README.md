### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Madeline, and I'm a quantitative social science researcher based in Pittsburgh. I'm currently finishing up a Pre Doctoral Data Science Fellowship with Carnegie Mellon and the Santa Fe Institute, and working in the Personality Processes Outcomes Laboratory at Pitt.

A lot of my work focuses on using machine learning techniques, as well as advanced statistical models to better understand human personality and cognition. Some of this is available here, but in some cases I have to host the data separately (since it's not mine).  I also host side projects on Github, which are normally small scale projects to expand my skillset.  

Thanks for your interest!
